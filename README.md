# Maisigh.ie

## Code Institute MS4 Project in Full Stack Frameworks
The brief was to build a full-stack site based around business logic used to control a centrally-owned dataset. The requirements included the set up of an authentication mechanism and to provide paid access to the site's data and/or other activities based on the dataset, such as the purchase of a product/service.

# Project Overview

## [Maisigh.ie Ecommerce App](http://maisigh-ms4.herokuapp.com)


![Am I Responsive Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload.png "Am I Responsive Image") 

[View website](http://maisigh-ms4.herokuapp.com) 
 
[Maisigh.ie](http://maisigh-ms4.herokuapp.com) is a fictional Ecommerce site that allows users to locate sustainable, Irish jewellery. For any non-native Irish speakers who may be slightly confused re the website name, 'maisigh' (pronounced mosh-she) is a Gaeilge word meaning 'to decorate, to accessorise or beautify'! 

Maisigh knows that simply having a good product is no longer enough to win a customer’s heart. They now want more than just quality, and demand products that align with their personal values. 
In the face of climate change, those of us who care enough are already considering the consequences of our shopping habits. Maisigh is fully committed to providing Irish handcrafted accessories with minimal impact on the environment. Enter Maisigh. Customers will adore the selection of fashion-forward, ethically-sourced products that they will fall in love with.

My own goals as a developer creating this project were to: 
- Develop a Ecommerce platform that enables the commercial process of buying and selling online including a search feature that allows users to locate desired products, a cart feature that lets them manage their order and a payment feature that allow them to purchase their items securely.
- Create an app that is highly accessible, responsive and simplistic in design.
- Create the backend code and frontend forms allowing admin users to add new products to the site, view them, edit them and delete them using CRUD operations.
- Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate products based on the item's fields providing full search functionality on the site.
- Provide these search results in a manner that is visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Design

![IMAGE](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image.png "IMAGE")

### Typography
I wanted to use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#about) for the headings and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans/#about) as a supporting body font to achieve the desired clean-cut, fashion-forward brand image.

### Icons
Font Awesome icons have been used for this project.

### Color Scheme
The Maisigh brand monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of natural fashion blush, sea blue and sage green to reflect the Irish and environmentally-friendly green products represented throughout the site.
I wanted to keep the colour palette simplistic and clean to allow for the imagery from the accessories to stand out and inject the site with colour.
However, the colour red is used for error messages or promotion content sitewide to captivate the user's attention.

I ended up creating and using the below palette once it had passed rigorous Accessibility testing in **A11y's Color Contrast Accessibility Validator**.

# Credits
## Code
I took inspiration from the following sources however I did implement my own custom code:

- I undertook a significant amount of research into backend development in preparation for the project. As well as the Code Institute's Boutique Ado tutorial which provided great guidance for the project, I also watched a significant amount of Youtube tutorials notably [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5).
